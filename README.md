ATC; an API gateway designed from the ground up to be vendor independent.

* **Reliable:** Utilizing the latest version of Java 21 and the new virtual threads, ATC will be a solid foundation for you to build        applications.
* **Speedy:** Speed is a must when there might be hundreds of hops between microservices within a stack before the user finally gets
a response. We can handle that, and more.
* **Free and Open Source, forever:** Every cloud vendor has their own proprietary solution to API management. Here, we aim to be independent of the big guys.
